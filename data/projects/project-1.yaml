description: Indibloggies was an annual blog-award clique for Indian Blogs. The site
  “showcased the best of the Indian blogosphere” and awarded English as well as Indic
  blogs authored by Indians and the Indian Diaspora. Indibloggies hosted 5 editions
  between 2003-2008 and became quite popular and is still regarded as prestigious
  by the winners. Though the modus-operandi had been different each year, the Indibloggies
  decided the winners in various award categories based on a mix of peer-review from
  a panel of jurors, public nominations and public voting. From 2005 onward Indibloggies
  used the social book marking site **[Del.icio.us](https://del.icio.us/)** to solicit
  category-wide public nominations. Indibloggies website theme and logo were designed
  by the talented Bangalore based designer [Hussain](http://chugsdesigns.com).<br><br>Indibloggies
  could be credited for recognizing some outstanding bloggers year after year. For
  example, **[Sonia Faleiro](https://www.soniafaleiro.com/)**, who’s blog was adjudged
  the "Best Topical Blog" in 2006 went on to win the CNN Young Journalist award the
  same year; **[Amit Varma](http://indiauncut.com/)**, author of “India Uncut”, won
  the “Best New Indiblog” award in 2005 and then went on to win the Bastiat Prize
  in 2007 and later landed a book deal with Hachette India. Similarly, **[Arnab Ray](https://greatbong.net/)**,
  a consecutive winner of "Best Indiblog" later landed a book deal with Harpercollins
  that was a best-seller.<br><br>Over the years Indibloggies also ran an essay series
  called **[Hum Blogistani](http://indibloggies.blogspot.in/search/label/Hum%20Blogistani)**
  that featured essays written by well known contemporary bloggers from the subcontinent,
  these are available as a [free ebook](//pothi.com/pothi/book/ebook-indibloggies-org-hum-blogistani-e-book).
  This publication is a collection of 10 essays published between 2005 to 2007 and
  provide a bird’s eye view of the state of the Indian blogosphere during that period.

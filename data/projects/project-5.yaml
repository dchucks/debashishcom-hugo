description: "Null Pointer started as a personal blog at [Rediff Blogs](http://web.archive.org/web/20050204064735/http://debashish.rediffblogs.com/) in April 2003 and then moved to [JRoller](http://web.archive.org/web/20060106215548/http://jroller.com/page/debashish) in July 2003. I have been writing about Technology (where the emphasis was on Java), Internet, Blogging, Indic-blogging, current-affairs, politics, entertainment industry and topics that concerned India. The name came from a popular exception in Java, indicating the previous sole focus of the blog on Java which slowly turned to uninitiated ramblings on other topics as well. I later moved to my own [Wordpress based hosting](http://nullpointer.debashish.com/null-pointer-moves-to-its-own-home) in 2006."

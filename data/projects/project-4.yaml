description: "Nirantar was a collaborative Hindi webzine I laucnhed in 2003 with fellow Hindi bloggers spread all around the World, prominently [Pankaj Narula](http://pnarula.com), [Jitendra Chaudhary](http://www.jitu.info/merapanna), [Anup Shukla](http://fursatiya.blogspot.in/), [Ravishankar Shrivastava](http://raviratlami.blogspot.com/), [Atul Arora](http://rojnamcha.org/) and [Raman Kaul](http://kaulonline.com/). Initially it was hosted by Pankaj over Drupal and Civic Space. It was later hosted at Nirantar.org over Wordpress and has been there ever since. The motivation behind the zine were manifold: consolidating the creative talent of Hindi blogdom under one hood; perhaps convincing others to take up blogging in Hindi (at that time a language spoken by 400 million people and understood by far greater number of people had only 40 odd persons blogging in the language); showcase the language blogging scenario in general and Hindi blogging in particular and above all providing a wholesome read on a plethora of topics concerning our nation and Indian blogging apart from other for the outside world. Between March 2005 and July 2008 we published [11 editions](http://www.nirantar.org/issues). Nirantar was later merged to [Samayiki](http://samayiki.com) which started publishing in a pure blog format rather than a magazine format.

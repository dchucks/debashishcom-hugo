description: Podbharati, India’s first pure Hindi Podzine targeted towards Hindi audience
  was launched & co-hosted by me with a blogger friend from Mumbai [Shashi Singh](//facebook.com/shashisingh)
  in 2009 with the intention to provide a comprehensive coverage of News & Views about
  Indian language blogging, Tools & Technology, Current Affairs and the Entertainment
  Industry. The Podcast (or Podzine, as we called it, given that each episode had
  multiple stories) was much appreciated and I still feel sad that we didn't continue
  it for long. Podbharti published 9 episodes with over 25 reports. It was hosted
  at Podbharti.com and the archives now live at Wordpress. The audio files were hosted
  at Blip.tv earlier, then on Podbazaar.com and now live on SoundCloud. Podbharti
  also got nominated for the [TATA NEN Hottest startup awards](//web.archive.org/web/20110715101342/http://www.podbharti.com/podbharti/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/dna-pune-nov12008.pdf)
  in 2008. **Pranav of StartupDunia** also published [an interview with me](//archive.is/V99A)
  regarding the website.<br><br>**Some reviews of Podbharati:**<br>**Amit Ranjan**,
  Co-founder of Slideshare and the man behind Digilocker wrote in his review of Podbharti,
  "The audio quality is great (having done podcasting myself, I can tell you that
  this is not easy, specially if you are recording over the internet). Moreover, the
  tone and style of the podcast is highly reminiscent of 1970-80s style radio, somewhat
  like Amin Sayani’s famous shows. Read through the [comments](//podbharti.wordpress.com/)
  on Podbharati’s posts and you will realize that this audience is clearly savoring
  the podcast’s content & style....At an overall level, Podbharati is a sign that
  podcasting has arrived in India."<br><br>Indian's most well known Tech ProBlogger
  **Amit Agarwal** [wrote on his blog Digital Inspiration](//archive.is/Ftadw), "Debashish,
  Shashi and friends launched the PodBharati Hindi Podcast in May 2007. It’s a mix
  of technology reviews, Indian Culture, Bollywood and Blogging. If can you understand
  hindi, PodBharati is one show you just cannot afford to miss – excellent production
  quality, content delivery and choice of topics. I can imagine the effort that goes
  into producing this show and considering that Deb, Shashi & co. are doing it out
  of their love for Hindi and Blogging, this is commendable."

description: "I was drawn to Hindi blogging during my work stint at Webdunia.com, a leading organization in the are of Indic localization. At the time there were only two Hindi blogs around, Vinay Jain's [Hindi](hindi.blogspot.in) and Alok's [Nau do gyarah](9211.blogspot.in). Alok is also credited for coining the term <i>Chittha</i> for Hindi blogs. So officially Nuktachini is the 4th Hindi blog ever published (the third blog belonged to a friend d.Padmaja](9211.blogspot.in) and was also created by me. The blog was noticed right from the early days, [here](//nuktachini.debashish.com/37) a mention in the Hindi magazine Kadambini, and enjoyed good readership.<br><br>**Some reviews of the blog**<br>Shastri Philip in his [review](//hindiblogosphere.blogspot.in/2007/10/nuktachini-hindi-blog.html) wrote: <blockquote>Debashish's modest comments do not reveal him and his work. Actually he is one of the pioneers in Hindi blogging. Blogging in Eastern languages has not been easy, but the boost came when a couple of visionaries decided to do something in Hindi. Debashish was one of them. The blog featured here is Nuktachini and it is a popular Hindi word for criticism. This does not mean that the blog is full of gossip. On the contrary, it is loaded with useful articles and you would soon feel that the name ought to have been something different.</blockquote> Nitin Pai, a well known blogger and founder of the Takshila Foundation & Pragati magazine [wrote](http://acorn.nationalinterest.in/2004/03/11/my-hindi-post-on-nukta-chini/),<blockquote>Debashish is leading the push towards Hindi blogs. I think blogging in th'vernacular is a great idea as it exposes a totally different audience to very different ideas.</blockquote>"
